I heare how humblit nwkill dule was maid
Be all his honrem, at the buriall ε

And justly; for ho stude thom in great stoad.
To leade them to the life celestiall.
But let us Pastors, and you pcople all,

Haste to that happiues whercin he is:
Professing truly Christ, on quhom we call,

As he hes teached aud p1·actise(l quhom we mis 2
Sa sall the preassing to his balmes,

Mal< us atteyue unto that happines.

To Tm: DEFUNCT.

Of Christ thou was the Pastor, and the seheip
That hard his voice, that lovinglie obeyit,
That fed his Lambis, aud cairfullie them kei pt
With painfull labour, and na tyme delayit,
On Christ thy hart was haillie set and stayit ;
Of Christ thou ever thocht, thou spak and wryte ;
With Christ thou wisscd all thy warkis arrayit,
In Christ, in life and dem, was thy delyto.
Be Christ, nocht cellis, thou socht to be perfyto:
And finallie thy Christ to the was all,
Sa hes he cround in thee that wark sa grah,
And brocht thee his blis perpetuall.
O ! micht I follow as I cleirlie see,

Thy rare example ! sa to live and die.
M. I. Mam-114.
